# Rebel Engine API translations

This folder contains the Rebel Engine API translation files.
These files are generated automatically.
The text strings to be translated are exported from the API XML files in the `docs` folder.
These text strings are then uploaded to Weblate, where they are translated by the community.
The translated strings are then downloaded from Weblate into this folder.

If you want to contribute to the Rebel Engine API translations, please use our Weblate project:
